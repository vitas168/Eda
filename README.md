# Eda

This sample application is created as a solution for iOS development test case for enrollment at Yandex. It performs a network query to get a list of restaurants for a particular location, parses the results, and displays the list containing restaurants' names, pictures, and descriptions.

The app illustrates the use of: 
- custom UI controls implemented programmatically;
- RxSwift for working with asynchronous requests;  
- SDWebImage, Kingfisher, and Nuke for image loading and caching;
- PinLayout for laying out UI elements;
- SwiftyJSON for parsing JSON;
- error handling.
